Billing 360 is a user-friendly website for small retailers that helps them to generate invoices, manage inventory, track customer debit and credit logs and also provides data-driven insights to help businesses grow efficiently. 

<!-- It minimizes the risk of manual billing errors, loss of records, and inefficient inventory management, addressing common challenges like misplaced registers, unnoticed long-standing stock, and improper handling of expiry-dated items. -->

I contributed to this project as a memeber of a team of 10 students, as part of a course project in the course CS253- Software Development & Operations during my 4th semester (2023-24-II). The project was developed from scratch in a plan-driven approach, using the MERN stack framework. This was also my first experience of documenting the requirements, design, implementation and user manual of the project.
