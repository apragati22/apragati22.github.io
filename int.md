<p>Leaving my academic interests aside, I have a deep love for traveling and exploring new places. My dream is to visit every corner of the world before I am timed out ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>I am also passionate about musicâ€”both listening and singing. Playing the musical keyboard is one of my favorite pastimes <em>(warning: you might accidentally join my fan club!)</em>. Additionally, I enjoy cooking a variety of dishes, with a particular fondness for the Indian cuisine. Badminton is another activity I love, especially when playing with friends.</p>

<p>When I have time to myself, I immerse myself in sci-fi, fiction, and thriller movies, although I also enjoy a good rom-com now and then. Some of my all-time favorites include <em>The Imitation Game</em>, <em>The Martian</em>, <em>Interstellar</em>, and <em>Onward</em>. Bollywood favourites include <em>Chor Nikal Ke Bhaaga</em>, <em>Raazi</em>, <em>Dangal</em> and <em>Taare Zameen Par</em>. Anyways, I am always in for movie plans ðŸ˜Š<p>
